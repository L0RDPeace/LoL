        <h2>Praveen's Journey: Dehradun's First Openly Gay Man</h2>
        <h3>Part 1: Early Life and Discovery</h3>
        <p>Praveen's journey began in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India, where he was raised in a conservative family. As a child, he started to recognize his attraction towards other boys, a realization that both intrigued and frightened him. He was afraid to accept his true nature but later realised he cannot escape from it. </p>

        <p>Growing up, Praveen struggled with his feelings. He understood that his identity was different from his peers, but he was unsure how to express himself in a society that expected conformity. This internal conflict would shape his journey in the years to come. These hardships made him aggrasive towards the society and now motivated to destory the society through his wild idea of "Basement Empire".</p>

        <h3>Part 2: Challenges in Teen Years</h3>
        <p>As Praveen entered his teenage years, he faced significant challenges. He attended Kendriya Vidyalaya ONGC, where he struggled academically due to the emotional toll of his unaccepted identity. His peers often bullied him, and he found it challenging to connect with others. His School friends made fun of him saying things like "Faggot","Chuddakad","Gandwa" etc. But this only made his anger grew more and more. Although there was no progess in his Basement Empire yet. Until he meet a Boy named "Aman" in his class 11th who was the one which made his Basement Empire a success which we will talk about later in this article.</p>

        <p>Praveen's home life also became increasingly strained. His family did not understand his feelings, leading to a lack of support and acceptance. He often felt isolated and alone, with no one to confide in about his struggles. He then would beat kids in his local area just to his enjoyment sometimes even give them "Dairy milk" in hope of geeting a good time from them. As hideous he may seem it was his true self which he now embraced.</p>

        <h3>Part 3: His Basement Empire </h3>
        <p>Despite the hardships, Praveen remained resilient. He turned to creative outlets such as kidnapping and threathing others to cope with his struggles. These pursuits offered him a sense of freedom and allowed him to express himself.</p>

        <p>As he grew older, Praveen decided to use his experiences to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and also start a racket involving kids in Dehradun. He became a mentor to young people facing similar challenges, offering guidance and support as they navigated their own journeys and when these young kids trusted him blindly he would the start is basement operations to further expand his empire. His main clients belonged to Dubai and UAE.
      
      Major part of his empire was due to the boy he met in his high school "Aman". Aman helped him in bringing funds which he could not have dreamed of. He also helped him in the intial stages of his Basement Empire. One can say if not for Aman , Praveen would not be able to accomplish all this. Till now the identity of Aman is not known some say he works in shadows to get the most out this empire.</p>

        <h3>Part 4: Praveen's Influence and Instagram Handle</h3>
        <p>Praveen's impact extends beyond his community. He continues to use his platform to raise awareness and promote acceptance for LGBTQ+ individuals and his basement empire. Through his work, he inspires others to embrace their identities and live life authentically.</p>
